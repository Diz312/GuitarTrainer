# Developer Agent Context Validation Tests

## ðŸ§  **CONTEXT COMPREHENSION VERIFICATION**

**Purpose:** Validate developer agent understanding before any coding begins  
**Approach:** Test architectural knowledge, design decisions, and integration planning  
**Requirement:** Agent must demonstrate solid understanding to proceed with development

## ARCHITECTURE UNDERSTANDING TESTS

### **Test 1: System Integration Design**
**Question:** "Explain how the Video Input module should integrate with the Pose Detection engine. What data structures will you use to pass information between them, and why?"

**Expected Understanding:**
- Video frames as numpy arrays (BGR format)
- Frame-by-frame processing pipeline
- Error handling for invalid frames
- Memory management considerations
- Data validation between components

### **Test 2: Component Responsibility Boundaries**
**Question:** "The GUI needs to display pose landmarks on video frames. Which component should handle the visualization logic - the GUI module, Pose Detection module, or a separate component? Justify your decision."

**Expected Understanding:**
- Separation of concerns principles
- GUI handles display/rendering only
- Pose detection provides raw landmark data
- Data transformation responsibilities
- Modularity for future enhancement

### **Test 3: Error Handling Strategy**
**Question:** "MediaPipe sometimes fails to detect poses in frames. Design the error handling flow from pose detection failure through to user notification. What should happen at each layer?"

**Expected Understanding:**
- Graceful degradation patterns
- Logging vs user notification
- Component isolation (failure doesn't crash app)
- Recovery strategies
- User experience considerations

## TECHNICAL DESIGN TESTS

### **Test 4: Configuration Management**
**Question:** "A user wants to adjust the pose detection confidence threshold. Trace the path from user setting to MediaPipe parameter. What components are involved and how do they communicate?"

**Expected Understanding:**
- Settings flow: GUI â†’ Config â†’ Pose Detector
- Environment variable management
- Runtime configuration updates
- Validation and bounds checking
- Default value handling

### **Test 5: Performance Considerations**
**Question:** "Video processing can be memory and CPU intensive. What strategies would you implement in each Phase 1 component to ensure smooth performance with 30-second guitar videos?"

**Expected Understanding:**
- Frame batching vs real-time processing
- Memory cleanup after processing
- Progress feedback mechanisms  
- Resource management patterns
- Optimization points without sacrificing educational clarity

### **Test 6: Educational Code Requirements**
**Question:** "You need to implement MediaPipe pose detection. How would you structure the code to be both educational (teaching CV concepts) and professional (maintainable architecture)?"

**Expected Understanding:**
- Extensive commenting strategy
- Code organization for readability
- Concept explanation in comments
- Example usage documentation
- Professional patterns with educational clarity

## INTEGRATION PLANNING TESTS

### **Test 7: Data Flow Design**
**Question:** "Design the complete data flow from 'user clicks load video' to 'pose landmarks displayed on screen'. Include error paths and validation points."

**Expected Understanding:**
- User interaction â†’ File dialog â†’ Video validation
- Frame extraction â†’ Pose detection â†’ Landmark filtering
- GUI update mechanisms
- Error handling at each step
- Status feedback to user

### **Test 8: Future Phase Compatibility**
**Question:** "Phase 2 will add biomechanical analysis of the pose data. How should you design the Phase 1 pose detection output to make Phase 2 integration seamless?"

**Expected Understanding:**
- Data structure extensibility
- Consistent coordinate systems
- Metadata preservation
- API design for future components
- Backward compatibility considerations

### **Test 9: Testing Strategy**
**Question:** "How would you test the Video Input â†’ Pose Detection integration without relying on the GUI? Design a testing approach for this pipeline."

**Expected Understanding:**
- Unit vs integration testing
- Mock video data generation
- Automated validation of pose detection
- Performance benchmarking
- Error scenario testing

## ADVANCED COMPREHENSION TESTS

### **Test 10: Multi-Component Scenario**
**Question:** "A user loads a corrupted video file that causes MediaPipe to crash. Walk through how your error handling would work across all three Phase 1 components to maintain application stability."

**Expected Understanding:**
- Try-catch boundaries at component interfaces
- Error propagation vs isolation
- Recovery mechanisms
- User feedback strategies
- Application state management

### **Test 11: Code Organization Rationale**
**Question:** "Why would you split pose detection into 'mediapipe_detector.py' and 'landmark_extractor.py' instead of keeping everything in one file? Explain the design benefits."

**Expected Understanding:**
- Single responsibility principle
- Testing isolation
- Code reusability
- Future extensibility (different pose detection backends)
- Maintenance and debugging benefits

### **Test 12: Educational Value Assessment**
**Question:** "A computer vision student will read your Video Input module code. What specific CV concepts should your code teach them, and how would you structure the learning progression?"

**Expected Understanding:**
- Video I/O fundamentals
- Frame processing concepts
- Format handling and validation
- Error patterns in CV applications
- Progressive complexity in examples

## VALIDATION SCORING

### **Minimum Passing Requirements:**
- **Architecture Questions (1-3):** Must demonstrate solid understanding of component integration
- **Technical Design (4-6):** Must show proper engineering practices
- **Integration Planning (7-9):** Must understand data flow and future compatibility
- **Advanced Comprehension (10-12):** Must show deep system thinking

### **Red Flags (Requires Bootstrap Enhancement):**
- Unclear component boundaries
- Poor error handling strategies
- Ignoring educational code requirements
- No consideration for future phases
- Weak integration design

### **Green Light Indicators:**
- Clear architectural reasoning
- Professional error handling approach
- Strong educational code philosophy
- Forward-thinking design decisions
- Comprehensive integration understanding

## CONTEXT TEST EXECUTION

### **Testing Process:**
1. **Present all questions to developer agent**
2. **Evaluate responses against expected understanding**
3. **Identify knowledge gaps**
4. **Enhance bootstrap documentation if needed**
5. **Re-test until satisfactory comprehension**
6. **Proceed with component development only after validation**

### **Decision Matrix:**
- **All tests passed:** Proceed with full Phase 1 development
- **Minor gaps:** Provide targeted clarification and re-test specific areas
- **Major gaps:** Enhance bootstrap documentation and full re-test
- **Fundamental misunderstanding:** Revise bootstrap approach

**This validation ensures the developer agent has sufficient context and understanding to build high-quality, integrated components that meet our educational and professional standards.**
