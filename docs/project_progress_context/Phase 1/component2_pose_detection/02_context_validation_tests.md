# Component 2 Context Validation Tests - MediaPipe Pose Detection

## üß™ **DEVELOPER AGENT UNDERSTANDING VERIFICATION**

**Purpose:** Verify developer agent comprehension of Component 2 requirements before beginning implementation  
**Component:** MediaPipe Pose Detection Engine  
**Prerequisites:** Complete review of bootstrap instructions

## üìã **CORE CONCEPT VALIDATION**

### **MediaPipe Integration Understanding**

**Q1:** What format does MediaPipe expect for input frames, and what conversion is required from OpenCV?
**Expected Answer:** MediaPipe expects RGB format, while OpenCV uses BGR. Must convert using `cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)` before processing.

**Q2:** How many pose landmarks does MediaPipe detect, and what coordinate system does it use?
**Expected Answer:** 33 body landmarks in normalized coordinates (0.0-1.0) relative to image dimensions.

**Q3:** Which landmarks are most relevant for guitar technique analysis?
**Expected Answer:** Shoulders (11,12), elbows (13,14), wrists (15,16), and hands for upper body posture and arm positioning.

### **Component Integration Understanding**

**Q4:** What interface does VideoLoader provide for Component 2 integration?
**Expected Answer:** `get_next_frame()` returns np.ndarray frames, `is_video_loaded()` checks status, plus video info and cleanup methods.

**Q5:** How should Component 2 integrate with the existing configuration system?
**Expected Answer:** Use `get_project_config().pose_detection` for hierarchical config access and `get_component_logger('pose_detection')` for logging.

## üî¨ **MICRO-INCREMENTAL METHODOLOGY VALIDATION**

### **Development Sequence Understanding**

**Q6:** What is the first micro-increment for Component 2, and what should it accomplish?
**Expected Answer:** MediaPipe initialization only - create pose model with specific parameters, verify model loads without errors.

**Q7:** Why must each micro-increment be tested immediately before proceeding?
**Expected Answer:** Early error detection, confidence building, ensures each piece works before adding complexity.

**Q8:** What testing is required after each micro-increment?
**Expected Answer:** Unit test for specific functionality, manual testing with real VideoLoader frame, educational comments validation.

### **Integration Strategy Understanding**

**Q9:** How should the pose detection results be structured for future Component 3 integration?
**Expected Answer:** Dictionary with `detection_success`, `landmarks` (guitar-specific), `average_confidence`, and `metadata` fields.

**Q10:** What error handling approach should be used for failed pose detections?
**Expected Answer:** Graceful degradation - return structured "no detection" result with detailed logging, no crashes.

## üèóÔ∏è **ARCHITECTURE DESIGN VALIDATION**

### **Configuration Integration**

**Q11:** How should pose detection parameters be configured?
**Expected Answer:** Through hierarchical YAML config with `pose_detection.core`, `pose_detection.guitar_analysis`, etc. sections.

**Q12:** What configuration parameters are most critical for guitar analysis?
**Expected Answer:** `model_complexity`, `min_detection_confidence`, `confidence_threshold`, and `focus_landmarks`.

### **Testing Strategy Understanding**

**Q13:** How should Component 2 testing integrate with Component 1 fixtures?
**Expected Answer:** Use same `test_video.mp4` fixture, test single frame detection and full video processing pipeline.

**Q14:** What should the `__main__` section in each module demonstrate?
**Expected Answer:** Manual testing with dynamic recursive printing of results, no hardcoded values, integration with VideoLoader.

## üìä **PERFORMANCE AND OPTIMIZATION VALIDATION**

### **Processing Strategy**

**Q15:** Should Component 2 process frames in batches or individually?
**Expected Answer:** Individual frame processing for micro-incremental development, easier testing, cleaner separation.

**Q16:** How should coordinate normalization be handled?
**Expected Answer:** MediaPipe returns normalized (0.0-1.0), convert to pixels using frame dimensions when needed for analysis.

### **Guitar-Specific Analysis**

**Q17:** Which body parts should be prioritized for guitar technique analysis?
**Expected Answer:** Upper body focus - shoulders for posture, wrists for positioning, hands for technique mechanics.

**Q18:** How should confidence thresholding be applied for reliable detection?
**Expected Answer:** Filter landmarks by visibility threshold (typically 0.7), only use high-confidence detections for analysis.

---

## üîó **EDUCATIONAL FOCUS VALIDATION**

### **Computer Vision Concepts**

**Q19:** What key pose estimation concepts should be explained in the code?
**Expected Answer:** Landmark detection vs object detection, confidence scoring, coordinate systems, biomechanical analysis preparation.

**Q20:** How should MediaPipe framework concepts be taught?
**Expected Answer:** Pre-trained model integration, pipeline optimization, cross-platform considerations, real-time vs batch processing.

### **Integration Patterns**

**Q21:** What software engineering patterns should be demonstrated?
**Expected Answer:** Component integration design, data structure compatibility, error propagation, performance optimization.

**Q22:** How should the code prepare for future analysis components?
**Expected Answer:** Structured output format, clear interfaces, metadata inclusion, guitar-specific landmark extraction.
